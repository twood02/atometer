# atometer

A package for **Atom** to measure how many keys you type each day.

Atometer tracks how many **letters**, **arrow keys**, **symbols**, and **new lines** you type and displays them in a handy odometer at the bottom right of your window (hover for more detailed data).  Statistics are tracked independently for each Atom project window you open and are saved on exit.

*How far have you typed today?*
